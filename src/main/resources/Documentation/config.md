Configuration
=========================

The gcloud-pubsub-events plugin is configured by adding a plugin stanza in the
`gerrit.config` file, for example:

```text
[plugin "gcloud-pubsub-events"]
    numberOfSubscribers = 6
    subscriptionId = instance-1
    gcloudProject = test_project
    privateKeyLocation = /var/gerrit/etc/secured_key.json

```

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.numberOfSubscribers`
:   The number of expected gcloud-pubsub-events subscribers. This will be used
    to allocate a thread pool able to run all subscribers.
    Default: 6
    
`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.gcloudProject`
:   GCloud [project name](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview#projects)

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.subscriptionId`
:   This value identifies the subscriber and it must be unique within your
    gerrit cluster to allow different gerrit nodes to consume data from the
    stream independently.
    Default: Gerrit instance-id

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.privateKeyLocation`
:   Path to the JSON file that contains service account key. The file
    should be readable only by the daemon process because it contains information
    that wouldnâ€™t normally be exposed to everyone.

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.sendAsync`
:   Send messages to GCloud PubSub asynchronously, detaching the calling
    process from the acknowledge of the message being sent.
    Default: true

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.ackDeadlineSeconds`
:   The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for
    the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message.
    Default: 10

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.subscribtionTimeoutInSeconds`
:   Maximum time to wait for the subscriber to connect to GCloud PubSub topic.
    Default: 10

`plugin.gcloud-pubsub-events.shutdownTimeout`
:   Maximum time to wait for the subscriber to disconnect from GCloud PubSub topic.
    Default: 10
